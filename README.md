# Screen Monitor with Tkinter and PyAutoGUI

## Overview

This Python program provides a simple graphical interface for monitoring a selected region of your screen. When a change occurs in the selected region, the program emits three beeps to alert you. It's a useful utility for keeping track of changes or updates in a specific area of your screen without having to continually check manually. Sort of pixel/screenshot or change detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- PyAutoGUI
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pillow (PIL)
- winsound (Windows-specific)
